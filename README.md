# CS320

Ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure begins with the requirements. Precise project requirements are a vital step in the development process. Without it, good tests cannot be written. For example, a program needs to count to 10, but the requirements do not specify the starting point; it could be -5 or 0. Additionally, can the program decrement as well as increment? These are essential pieces of information for proper testing.
